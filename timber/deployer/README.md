# Deployer
This is an **example** of a microservice which could deploy a smart contract containing a merkle tree.  

In reality, you'll replace this microservice with your own application which wishes to use a merkle-tree.  

Your application will then call the [merkle-tree microservice](/merkle-tree/README.md) via its API routes.  

Hopefully this microservice provides a clear example for how to take an existing application, and leverage the [merkle-tree microservice](/merkle-tree/README.md).
