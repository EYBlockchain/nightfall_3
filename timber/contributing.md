# Contributing to Timber

As an auditor, EY has to comply with strict procedures to ensure that we maintain independence from any organisations we audit. Accordingly, we would be very grateful to receive PRs for bug fixes or efficiency improvements to the existing code. New features should be added by forking this repository.

The requirement to maintain independence is also the reason that we have waived all copyright and placed the code in the public domain, rather than using a more conventional open source licensing approach.
