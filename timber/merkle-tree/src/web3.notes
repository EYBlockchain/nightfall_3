MIKE'S NOTES ON USEFUL WEB3 FUNCTIONS, AND THE OBJECTS THEY PRODUCE:

web3.eth.getBlockNumber([callback]) // Returns the current block number.
// web3.eth.getCode(address [, defaultBlock] [, callback]) //gets bytecode (not needed)
web3.eth.getBlock(blockHashOrBlockNumber [, returnTransactionObjects] [, callback]) // Returns a block matching the block number or block hash.
web3.eth.getBlockTransactionCount(blockHashOrBlockNumber [, callback]) // Returns the number of transaction in a given block.
//web3.eth.getTransaction(transactionHash [, callback]) // Returns a transaction matching the given transaction hash.
web3.eth.getTransactionFromBlock(hashStringOrNumber, indexNumber [, callback]) // Returns a transaction based on a block hash or number and the transactions index position.
//web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(hash [, callback]) // Returns the receipt of a transaction by transaction hash.
web3.eth.call(callObject [, defaultBlock] [, callback]) // Executes a message call transaction, which is directly executed in the VM of the node, but never mined into the blockchain.

// TRANSACTION OBJECT
// Promise<object> - A transaction object its hash transactionHash:
//
// hash 32 Bytes - String: Hash of the transaction.
// nonce - Number: The number of transactions made by the sender prior to this one.
// blockHash 32 Bytes - String: Hash of the block where this transaction was in. null when its pending.
// blockNumber - Number: Block number where this transaction was in. null when its pending.
// transactionIndex - Number: Integer of the transactions index position in the block. null when its pending.
// from - String: Address of the sender.
// to - String: Address of the receiver. null when its a contract creation transaction.
// value - String: Value transferred in wei.
// gasPrice - String: The wei per unit of gas provided by the sender in wei.

transactionHash 32 Bytes - String: Hash of the transaction.
transactionIndex- Number: Integer of the transactions index position in the block.
from - String: Address of the sender.
to - String: Address of the receiver. null when its a contract creation transaction.
contractAddress - String: The contract address created, if the transaction was a contract creation, otherwise null.
