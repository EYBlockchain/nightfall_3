# Optimist
To launch a stand alone optimist:
1. Copy `optimist.copy.env` to `optimist.env`
2. Configure variables in `optimist.env`
3. Launch optimist
```
./start-optimist.sh [OPTIONS]
```
`OPTIONS` include:
- -d|--delete : Delete mondodb contents
- -e|--environment : Set Nightfall environment. Possible values are `mainnet` and `testnet`. If `environment` is not configured, it is assumed that optimist is to be attached to the Nightfall environment that results from launching `./start-nightfall`
4. To stop optimist:
```
./stop-optimist.sh
```


## Configuration
File `optimist.env` contains the configuration variables needed. When launching `./start-optimist.sh`, two containers, mongoDb and optimist, are deployed.
- **MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME** : MongoDb username. 
- **MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD** : MongoDb password. 
- **MONGO_PORT** : Port where MongoDb is served.
- **OPTIMIST_PORT** :  HTTP optimist port
- **OPTIMIST_WS_PORT** : WebSocket optimist port
- **BLOCKCHAIN_URL** : Websocket Web3 URL (wss://web3.test.com). Alternatively, one can pass a host and a port so
that it Web3 websocket can be found at ws://${BLOCKCHAIN_WS_HOST}:${BLOCKCHAIN_PORT}
- **BLOCKCHAIN_WS_HOST** : Websocket Web3 host (i.e, localhost)
- **BLOCKCHAIN_PORT** : Websocket Web3 port (8546)

## Operation
Scripts provided can spin an optimist and connect it to an existing testnet or mainntet nightfall deployment. In this case, one needs to have access to Web3 node.
Alternatively, the optimist can connect to the sandbox environment provided by `./start-nightfall` script. In this case, it is not necessary to provide `BLOCKCHAIN_URL` parameters. The same ganache node will be automatically configured.

 ## Applications
 This stand alone optimist have been thought to be used with `nightfall_3/apps` applications. This folder includes several applications that use the optimist to provide certain applications such as:
 - Proposer
 - Challenger
 - Synchronizer

 In order to configure the optimist in one of these roles:
 1. Launch optimist with `./start-optimist.sh`
 2. Ensure `optimist.env` is configured.
 3. Go to the folder including the role you need (`apss/proposer`) and launch `npm start`
