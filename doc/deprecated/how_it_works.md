# How Nightfall zk optimistic rollup works

## Actors

There are three actors involved in the process:

- Transactors
- Proposers
- Challengers

A `Transactor` is a normal customer of the service. They wish to make `Transactions` i.e. Deposit,
Transfer, Withdraw. Anyone can be a Transactor. They pay a fee for the service.

A `Proposer` proposes new updates to the state of the Shield contract. By _state_, we mean
specifically the storage variables that are associated with a zkp transaction: nullifiers, and
commitment roots. Update proposals contain many `Transactions`, rolled up into a layer 2 `Block` and
only a hash of the final state, that would exist after all the Transactions in the Block were
processed, is stored. The system could be configured with a maximum number of proposers. Anyone can
become a Proposer if this maximum number is not reached but they must post a minimum stake that is
also configured in the system. All these parameters could be updated according to a multisig
administrator contract. The stake is intended to incentivise good behaviour and also is the base to
calculate the proposer set for the selection of next proposer. Using a similar approach to Polygon
proposer selection protocol, with proposer set based on staking, and Tendermintâ€™s proposer selection
based in a weighted round robin algorithm, Nightfall will select next proposer. Every time the
current proposer propose a block part of this stake is blocked, which is paid to a successful
challenger. Proposers make money by providing correct blocks and collecting fees from transactors.
They are somewhat analogous to Miners in a conventional blockchain although the way they operate is
completely different.

A `Challenger` challenges the correctness of a proposed block. Anyone can be a Challenger. They make
money from correct challenges.

## Contracts

The following contracts are relevant (others play no specific role in the optimistic rollup process
and have the same functionality as conventional nightfall).

- `Shield.sol` - this enables a user to submit a transaction for processing by a Proposer. If it's a
  deposit Transaction, it will take payment. It also allows anyone to request that the state of the
  Shield contract (commitment root and nullifier lists) is updated. When the state is updated, any
  withdrawals in the update will be processed (we don't yet allow immediate withdrawal; one needs to
  wait until a block is finalised). Note that there is no fundamental need to post a transfer or
  withdraw transaction to the blockchain: it's simply acting as a message board for proposers to
  pick up the transaction and incorporate it into a layer 2 Block. These days, that's a lot of Gas
  for a bit of convenience. Therefore this functionality can be disabled and transfer transactions
  sent directly to a proposer endpoint (see below).
- `Proposers.sol` - functionality for registering, deregistering, paying and changing the current
  proposer and, most importantly, proposing a new Layer 2 Block to the blockchain.
- `Challenges.sol` - functionality to enable a Block to be challenged as incorrect in some way.
- `MerkleTree_Computations.sol` - A stateless (pure function) version of the original
  `MerkleTree.sol`, used by `Challenges.sol` to help compute challenged blocks on-chain.
- `Utils.sol` - collects together functionality which is either used in multiple contracts or which,
  if left inline, would affect readability of code.
- `Config.sol` - holds constants rather like a Nodejs config file. Also has some parameters that
  could be configure with a multisig administrator contract.
- `Structures.sol` - defines global structs, enums, events, mappings and state variables. It makes
  these easier to find.

## Operation

We assume that several Proposers have registered with the system, posting a bond (I set this at 10
ETH) to do so.

### Transaction posting

#### **On-chain**

The process starts with a Transactor creating a transaction by calling `submitTransaction` on
`Shield.sol`. The Transactor pays a fee to the Shield contract for the Transaction, which can be
anything the Transactor decides. Ultimately this will be paid to the Proposer that incorporates the
Transaction in a Block. The higher the fee, the more likely a Proposer is to pick up the
Transaction.

The Transaction call causes a Transaction event to be posted, containing the details of the
Transaction. If the Transaction is a Deposit, the Shield contract takes payment of the layer 1 ERC
token in question.

#### **Off-chain**

Transfer and Withdraw transactions have the option of being submitted directly to listening
proposers rather than being submitted on-chain via the above process. These off-chain transactions
will save transactors the on-chain submission cost (~45k gas), but requires a greater degree of
trust from transactors with the proposers they choose to connect to. It is easier for bad acting
proposers to censor transactions received off-chain than those received on-chain.

### Transaction receival

When proposers receive any transactions, they perform a range of checks to validate that the
transaction is well-formed and that the proof verifies against the public inputs hash.

If this is true in both cases, the transaction is added to proposer's mempool to be considered in a
`Block`.

### Block assembly and submission

Proposers wait until the Shield contract assigns them as the current proposer (presently this is
done by simple rotation, we feel this should be random but we can't actually see a problem with
rotation).

The current proposer looks at the available Transactions and chooses one. Normally this would be the
one with the highest fee. They compute the new commitment Merkle-tree that _would_ come into being
_were_ this transaction to be added to the Shield contract next.

The current Proposer repeats this process n times, until they have assembled a Block, which contains
the hashes of the Transactions included in the Block and the commitment Merkle-tree root as it would
exist after processing all the transaction in the block (Commitment Root).

They then call `Proposers.proposeBlock(...)` and pass in the Block struct that they have just
assembled. The hash of this Block is then stored in a queue consisting of a linked-list of Block
hashes. They have to stake a `BLOCK_STAKE` to do this, which is additional to their bond.

The submission triggers emission of NewLeaf/NewLeaves events for a Timber listener. The Timber
listener must realise that these new leaves may be removed after a successful challenge and thus
must incorporate logic to wait for finalisation.

### Challenges

The blocks will be challengeable in the queue for a week, during which time their correctness may be
challenged by calling one of the challenging functions in `Challenges.sol`. The challenger will need
to pass in Block struct and the Transaction structs that are contained in the block, because the
blockchain does not retain these. `Challenges.sol` will confirm this data against its stored Block
hashes and then do an on-chain computation to determine the correctness of the challenge (the
details of the computation being dependent on the type of challenge). The challenges that can be
made are:

- INVALID_PROOF - the proof given in a transaction does not verify as true;
- INVALID_PUBLIC_INPUT_HASH - the public input hash of a transaction is not the correct hash of the
  public inputs;
- HISTORIC_ROOT_EXISTS - the root of the commitment Merkle Tree used to create the transaction proof
  has never existed;
- DUPLICATE_NULLIFIER - A nullifier, given as part of a Transaction is present in the list of spent
  nullifiers;
- HISTORIC_ROOT_INVALID - the updated commitment root that results from processing the transactions
  in the Block is not correct.
- DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION - An identical transaction included in this block has already been included
  in a prior block.
- TRANSACTION_TYPE_INVALID - The transaction is not well-formed based on the transaction type (e.g.
  DEPOSIT, TRANSFER, WITHDRAWAL).

Should the challenge succeed, i.e. the on-chain computation shows it to be a valid challenge, then
the following actions are taken by `Challenges.sol`:

- The hash of the Block in question and all subsequent Blocks are removed from the queue;
- The Block stake, submitted by the Proposer, is paid to the Challenger;
- The Transactors with a Transaction in the Block are reimbursed the fee that they would have paid
  to the Proposer and any escrowed funds held by the Shield contract in the case of a Deposit
  transaction.
- The Proposer is delisted.

### State incorporation

We don't explicitly incorporate new state. Any block that is more than a week old is assumed final.
`Shield.withdraw` can be called to withdraw funds from a finalised block. For this reason, Blocks
that are final cannot be challenged.

## Avoiding front-running attacks

Challengers submit valid challenges using a 'commit-reveal' scheme to mitigate the risk that their
challenge can be front-run. The Challenger does not challenge immediately but provides a salted hash
of the Challenge information. This hash is saved against the sender's address.

Once that transaction has gone through, the Challenger sends the complete Challenge information
along with the salt. The contract then checks:

- the data sent is the pre-image of the hash, once the salt is added.
- the originating address is the same for both transactions

A front-runner would be alerted that a challenge has been made but would have to find the flawed
Block themselves and front-run before the challenge hash is written to the blockchain. This is not
completely impossible but they have very little time to find the flawed Block and so are unlikely to
succeed, or rather they have no more chance of succeeding than anyone else, which is fair game.
